# 🌸 Paddona

> **A social impact app empowering rural Indian women with access to menstrual hygiene products**  
> 🏆 Technovation Regional Winner – Bangalore | 🌍 Global Semifinalist 2018

## 📱 Overview

**Paddona** (sanitary "Pads" + "Dona"tions, also it rhymes with Maddona) is an Android application built by a team of 15-year-old girls as part of the **Technovation Challenge 2018**.

The app addresses the serious issue of menstrual hygiene in India, where only **18% of menstruators** have access to sanitary products. Our goal was to create a solution that could **bridge the gap between affordability, accessibility, and dignity**.

## 💡 Why We Built This

While brainstorming ideas for the challenge, we came across a heartbreaking real-life story of a **12-year-old girl from rural India** who had to undergo a **uterus removal surgery** due to an infection caused by poor menstrual hygiene.

This ignited our mission.

We realized menstrual health was both **a health crisis** and **a social stigma** — especially in rural and underprivileged communities. Inspired to act, we built Paddona with three core goals:

- Provide **free or low-cost sanitary pads** to menstruators with **BPL (Below Poverty Line) cards**
- Enable **donations** through the app to fund the production and distribution of sanitary products
- Create a **sustainable supply chain** by linking **textile industries** with **pad manufacturers** to repurpose surplus materials

## 🚀 Our Journey

In 2015, we were inspired by seniors from our school who won the Technovation Challenge and even met the Prime Minister of India. At the age of 10, we set our sights on joining the challenge too — and 5 years later, we did.

With the support of our Computer Science teacher Ms. Srividya and mentorship from Adobe, we took a simple idea and built it into a prototype app with **real-world potential**.
